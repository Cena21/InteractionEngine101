# Interaction Engine 101

This example project demonstrates what the Interaction Engine does in a playable tutorial (supports Oculus and Vive). The code for each example can be used as a reference for building your own projects that make use of the Interaction Engine to allow Leap hands to manipulate physical objects in Unity.
